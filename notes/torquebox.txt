* download and unpack torquebox (cache locally)
* delete its JRuby 
* download and unpack our JRuby version (cache locally)
* bundle install --without test development into it
* create the rails app archive (knob) - rake torquebox:archive - required custom rake task
* copy the app archive and JRuby install into torquebox
* copy in some startup / shutdown scripts (these setup torquebox env vars and launch / stop the server)
* tar it up, scp it to a test machine (only java installed)
* launch the torquebox server and run Capybara tests against it
